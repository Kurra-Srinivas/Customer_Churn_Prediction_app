# Customer Churn Prediction ML Project with Streamlit

## Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to predict customer churn using Python. It includes data analysis, feature engineering, and model training with scikit-learn, optimized using GridSearchCV across multiple models. The final model is deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app for real-time churn predictions. This project is designed for beginners and professionals to learn churn prediction, gain insights, and showcase results through a user-friendly interface.

## Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Visualize and explore customer data to uncover churn patterns.
- **Feature Engineering**: Process and create features to improve model performance.
- **Machine Learning**: Train and optimize multiple models (4â€“5) using scikit-learn with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Streamlit App**: Deploy an interactive web app to predict churn based on user inputs.
- **Dataset**: Expects a churn dataset (e.g., `churn_data.csv`) with features like tenure, charges, and a binary churn column.
